# TEAM18 Visual Cryptography
üëã We are TEAM18 of NTU Digital Image Processing course
<br/>
## Introduction
üèÜ Our term project consists of two parts:
1. Visual Cryptography main program
2. User Interface
## How to run
### Visual Cryptography main program

```
You may find the test file from `./main-program/Sample_210x148` or `./main-program/Sample_297x210`
3. If you would like to stack 2 crypto images into 1, execute the following command:
```bash
python decode.py [X1] [X2] [res]
```
